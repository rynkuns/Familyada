# Familyada

A project on hold, made for a party I hosted, during which I conducted and hosted a game of Familiada (en. Family Feud). 
This project has been made for my personal use only. I do not own any rights to the Family Feud format.
All of the images were made by me, the audio was obtained from online libraries (I plan to rerecord everything myself somewhere in the future).
